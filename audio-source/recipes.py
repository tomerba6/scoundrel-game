"""The recipe for every sound effect: what it is meant to sound like, and how it is built.

Written without being heard - Claude cannot listen - so each recipe says in its
docstring what it is *meant* to be, and the listening rounds judge whether it
is. The numbers are starting points to be tuned by ear.

The file names mirror the Java contract, `com.tomer.scoundrel.audio.Sound`:
`<sound>_<version>`, or `<sound>_<weight>_<version>` for a weighted sound.
AudioAssetsTest holds the folder to that enum, and check.py holds this list to
the folder, so the three cannot drift apart silently.

Weights index 0 = light, 1 = medium, 2 = heavy. The thud has no medium.
