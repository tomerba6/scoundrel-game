"""Scoundrel's placeholder music, the two end-of-run cues and the torch's crackle.

Composed without being heard - Claude cannot listen - so each piece says in its
docstring what it is meant to be, and listening round 3 judges it. The music is
the part most likely to be replaced (docs/audio.md, Sourcing); this is the
placeholder that lets the whole game be wired and timed first.

D minor, 64 BPM, 16-bar loops of exactly 60 s. Two bars a chord:
i - VI - iv - V, i - VI - VII - V, with the harmonic minor's A major for the
pull home.

Loops are seamless by construction, never by trimming:
- anything that rings past the loop's end (a pluck, the reverb) is folded back
  onto its start, where it will be heard when the loop comes round;
- anything sustained (the drone, the breathing) completes a whole number of
  cycles in a loop, so it meets itself exactly;
- filters on a finished loop work on it as a circle (synth.circular_filter).

The stream names mirror com.tomer.scoundrel.audio.StreamFile; AudioAssetsTest holds
the folder to that enum and check.py holds it to this list.
