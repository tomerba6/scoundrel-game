# audio-source — Scoundrel's synthesized audio

The placeholder sound effects, and later the music, are **rendered here by Python** and committed
under `assets/audio/`. The game only ever loads the rendered files. The reference for what ships
is [`docs/audio.md`](../docs/audio.md); the plan and its progress are in
[`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-audio.md`](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-audio.md).

```bash
python -m pip install --user -r audio-source/requirements.txt   # numpy + soundfile, pinned
python audio-source/render.py     # writes assets/audio/sfx/*.wav
python audio-source/check.py      # measures them; non-zero exit on any failure
python audio-source/audition.py   # builds audio-source/build/audition.html to listen to
```

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `synth.py` | The building blocks, numpy only: oscillators, struck-object (modal) synthesis, bubbles, plucked strings, hand-written filters, saturation, the lo-fi stage, and loudness measurement |
| `recipes.py` | One recipe per sound. Each docstring says what the sound is *meant* to be, because it was written without being heard |
| `render.py` | Renders every recipe to a 16-bit mono 44.1 kHz WAV |
| `check.py` | The measurements that stand in for ears: format, peak ≤ −1 dBFS, attack within 5 ms, silent tail, no DC, length, loudness on target, versions that aren't near-copies, and the committed files matching a fresh render. It also reports brightness by weight |
| `audition.py` | The listening page: every file, plus scenes played the way the game will play them, with the game's rules read from the Java source |
| `replaced.txt` | Files replaced by a sourced sound, which `render.py` must never overwrite |

**Rules:**

- **Deterministic.** Each file is seeded by its own name, and the versions are pinned, so an
  unchanged recipe re-renders to the same bytes. `check.py` fails if the committed files and a
  fresh render differ.
- **The file names are the contract** with the game (`com.tomer.scoundrel.audio.Sound`).
  `AudioAssetsTest` holds `assets/audio/sfx/` to that enum, and `check.py` holds it to these
  recipes.
- **Nothing but shipped audio goes under `assets/`.** The audition page and scratch renders go
  in `build/` (gitignored).
- **The lo-fi stage** is the "crunchy" in crunchy lo-fi: sample-and-hold down to a lower rate
  (the aliasing is the crunch), mild bit-crushing, then a low-pass so the result is warm rather
  than fizzy. Its settings, like every recipe's numbers, are starting values tuned by ear in the
  listening rounds.
