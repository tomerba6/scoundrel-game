 * Three weapons share a light blade, and without the nudge a Rusted Shiv and a
 * Hatchet would be the same sound. The nudge restarts in every weight — the
 * lightest of the heavies is pitched <em>up</em> — because the weight has
 * already said "heavier" with a different file, and the nudge only has to tell
 * neighbours apart.
 *
 * <p>Values outside a scale take its nearest edge. The standard deck never deals
 * one, but a future card definition may, and it should still make a sound.
