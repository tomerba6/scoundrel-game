/**
 * Which music is playing, how loud, and when the one-shot cues fire — as a pure
 * function of what the screens report and the time that has passed. The
 * streams themselves are played elsewhere; this only answers, every frame, how
 * loud each track should be ({@link #gain}) and what to start
 * ({@link #tick}'s {@link Command}s).
 *
 * <p>It lives in the navigator, not a screen, so the music outlives the screen
 * changes that would otherwise restart it: the menu track plays on across the
 * title, mode select, ledger and trophies. Screens cut; the music crossfades.
 * Audio is the deliberate exception to the cut rule, like the torch light,
 * because a hard cut in music sounds like a fault where a cut in the picture
 * does not.
 *
 * <p>The end of a run is sequenced here:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Death</b> — the run music is left alone through the flare, the shake
 *       and the settle, then dies with the torch over the window the death
 *       cinematic passes in, and the death cue plays as YOU DIED grows in.
 *       Clicking through fades quickly and plays the cue at once if it has not
 *       played — never twice.</li>
 *   <li><b>Win</b> — the end panel is up at once, but the winning blow is
 *       still landing, so the music waits for the board to go idle, fades, and
 *       only then cues.</li>
 *   <li><b>The chime</b> — trophies unlocked — waits for both the end panel
 *       and the cue to have finished, so it never lands on top of either.</li>
 * </ul>
 * After that the panel is quiet but for the torch, until the player leaves.
 *
 * <p>The death's timing is passed in rather than read, because it belongs to
 * the death cinematic in the screens, which this package may not import.
