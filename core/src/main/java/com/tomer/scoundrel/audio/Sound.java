/**
 * Every sound effect in the game, and the files each one is rendered to.
 *
 * <p>The file names are the contract — like the sprite region names — between
 * the Python that renders {@code assets/audio/sfx/} and the code that plays it:
 * {@code <sound>_<version>}, or {@code <sound>_<weight>_<version>} for a
 * weighted one. {@link #allFiles()} is the one list both sides are checked
 * against.
 *
 * <p>The list is closed on purpose. The game is fast — cards act on press, and
 * a click during an animation skips it — so every moment gets exactly one
 * sound, and a sound that would always land on top of another was cut: the
 * weapon wearing down (it fires with every weapon kill), the old weapon being
 * discarded (it happens inside the equip), a heal (it would sit on the drink),
 * and taking damage, which is folded into the hit as the {@link #THUD}.
 *
 * <p>Only a sound heard often has more than one version, and only those vary
 * in pitch and volume. The rare moments sound identical every time, which is
 * what makes them recognisable.
