/**
 * Sounds waiting for their beat. A move is settled the instant it is pressed,
 * but its animation is not, and a sound played on the press arrives before the
 * blade does — so each sound is held until its effect's clock reaches its beat.
 *
 * <p>Every click during an animation skips it, and in fast play that is most
 * clicks. A skipped animation must still sound: {@link #flush()} hands over
 * everything pending at once, so every action is heard exactly once however
 * fast the player goes. The same rule the board already follows for the heal a
 * skipped drink still pours.
 *
 * <p>Times are on whatever clock the caller keeps — the board runs one per
 * effect — so a slowed effect (the killing blow runs at half speed) slows its
 * sounds with it.
