/**
 * Chooses which version of a sound plays, never the same one twice in a row.
 *
 * <p>An identical recording repeated back to back stops reading as an event
 * and starts reading as a sample — the "machine-gun effect" — and this game
 * repeats: four flips a room, twenty-six kills a run. A plain random pick
 * would still hand out the same version twice a third of the time with three
 * of them, so the last pick of each sound is remembered and excluded.
 *
 * <p>Remembered per stem ({@code blade_light}, {@code flip}), because that is
 * what the ear compares: two different sounds sharing a version number is not
 * a repeat. Seeded, so a test can pin the sequence.
