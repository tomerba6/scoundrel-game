/**
 * The scripted first-run: a curated dungeon (played through the engine's exact
 * ordered-deck entry) and the beats that narrate it. The deck is arranged so
 * every rule surfaces in turn — bare-handed and armed combat, weapon
 * degradation both ways, a weapon upgrade, potion healing and the one-per-turn
 * cap, avoiding (and not twice in a row) — and the run ends in a win with
 * health to spare. Scoring is taught in two beats where it bites: the negative
 * losing score after the run's heaviest blow, and what a cleared dungeon is
 * worth with the last monster still standing.
