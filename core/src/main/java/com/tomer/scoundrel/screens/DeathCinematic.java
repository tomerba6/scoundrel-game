/**
 * Dying: the blow flares, the board shakes and is then <em>left standing</em>,
 * the torch gutters out over it, the depth ticker outlives everything else, and
 * only once that has gone does YOU DIED grow in.
 *
 * <p>The screen dies by <b>pattern, never alpha</b>. An alpha fade dims every
 * pixel toward black together, which reads as a dialog covering the game; an
 * ordered dither turns pixels off in a fixed order, so the board stays legible
 * through it and thins out until it is gone. That is the difference between the
 * game being obscured and the game failing.
 *
 * <p>The pacing is the point, and this is deliberately the slowest thing in the
 * game. An earlier version wiped the board in half a second and had the title up
 * before the loss had registered, which made a death read as a page turn. Now
 * the board is held dead and lit for the best part of a second — long enough to
 * read the empty bar and the number under zero — and the light is taken away
 * before the board is. The whole thing can be clicked through at any point.
