/**
 * The room of face-up cards: the frames, the sprites in their wells, the
 * printing on them, and everything that happens to one when it is resolved.
 * One class so the developer lab and the real board draw the same thing — the
 * lab is only a verification instrument if what it shows is literally what the
 * game shows.
 *
 * <p>It owns the idle clock, each card's stagger, and the effect currently
 * running. It owns no game state and no rules: callers say which cards are in
 * the room, what just happened to one of them, and where the pointer is.
 *
 * <p>Every effect's timing lives in its own pure class ({@link CardFlight},
 * {@link WeaponKill}, {@link Barehanded}, {@link PotionDrink}); what is here is
 * the sequencing and the draw calls.
 *
 * <p>And the sound, on the same clocks. Each effect is handed the sounds its move
 * makes and holds them until its beat ({@link Beats}): the blade is heard as the
 * slash crosses, not on the click. The deal's flips wait on the deal's clock,
 * one per card the dungeon sends up, stepping down the riffle. A skip plays
 * whatever is still waiting, at once — every click during an animation skips it,
 * so in fast play that is most of them, and every action must still sound once.
