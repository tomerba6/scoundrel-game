/**
 * The frame every navigable screen draws inside: the 1280×720 surface, the
 * viewport that scales it to the window, the torchlit backdrop behind it, and
 * the press gesture that turns clicks into targets.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #render(float)} is final, and that is the point of this class.</b>
 * Activating a target navigates, and navigating disposes this screen along with
 * its batch and surface — drawing afterwards reads freed native memory and takes
 * the JVM down with an {@code EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION} rather than throwing
 * something a test could catch. That guard used to be hand-copied into five
 * screens. Here it is written once, above a {@link #drawContent} a subclass
 * cannot reach until the check has passed.
 *
 * <p>The two passes are equally load-bearing. Everything is drawn at 1:1 onto
 * the surface, and that one image is scaled to the window once — drawn straight
 * to the window instead, every quad rounds separately and identical features
 * disagree by a pixel. See {@code HANDOFF.md} §4.
 *
 * <p>{@code SpriteLab} deliberately does not extend this: it has no press
 * gesture and no backdrop, and it is a developer tool rather than a screen
 * anyone navigates to.
