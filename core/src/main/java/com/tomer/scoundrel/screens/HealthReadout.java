 * What the health bar and its number say right now, which is not always what

 * press the card, but nothing may appear at the bar until the bottle has flown
 * there and tipped — a fill with no visible cause reads as the bar glitching.
 * So between the press and the pour the bar {@link Phase#HELD holds} the
 * reading it is about to leave.
 *
 * <p>That choice used to be a branch inside the screen, and it was wrong: the
 * held case fell through to "at rest", which paints the state's own health. The
 * bar filled on the press, then rewound and filled again on the pour. It is a
 * decision rather than a drawing, so it lives out here where it can be pinned.
