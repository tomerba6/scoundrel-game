/**
 * The bottle a <em>wasted</em> potion collapses into: the same pixels as the one
 * you actually drink, with the colour drained out of them.
 *
 * <p>Drained rather than greyed. Averaging a pixel's channels invents a colour
 * that appears nowhere in the art; {@link Ramps#drain} moves it sideways to the
 * bone ramp at the step it already occupied, which keeps every pixel inside the
 * eighty and keeps the light-to-dark structure intact. The bottle still looks
 * round and still reads as glass — it has simply gone dead.
 *
 * <p>Generated once at load, exactly as the hurt and rim frames are, so nothing
 * is tinted at draw time and no blend can produce an off-palette colour.
