 *
 * <p>Coordinates are 1280×720 with y measured downward, as the art is
 * specified; {@link CardArt#toWorldY} converts when drawing.
 *
 * <p>Note that the chrome colours are <b>not</b> all on the sprite ramps. The

 * ramp steps. Sprites are strictly on-palette; the furniture around them is
 * whatever the design drew, and matching it exactly is what lets a render be
 * diffed against the reference pixel for pixel.
