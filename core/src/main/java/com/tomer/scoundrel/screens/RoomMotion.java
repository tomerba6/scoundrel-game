 * <p>Resolving a card sets three things going, and they are not one thing:
 * what happens to the card that left, the survivors re-centring around the gap
 * it made, and whatever the dungeon sends up to replace it. Running all three
 * in sequence made a single resolve take the best part of a second and read as
 * three separate events; running all three at once flies a fresh card over the
 * top of the one being killed.
 *
 * <p>So the room <b>closes</b> alongside the effect and the <b>deal</b> waits
 * for it. The gap shuts as the monster dies, which is one event, and only then
 * does the dungeon offer up the next card, which is another.
