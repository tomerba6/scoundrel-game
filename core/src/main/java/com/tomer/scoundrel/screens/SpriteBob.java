/**
 * The idle bob: every sprite on the board rising and settling together, as one
 * breath.
 *
 * <p>It moves the <b>sprite alone</b> — the card's frame, header and value stay
 * exactly where they are, so the art breathes inside its window rather than the
 * whole card wobbling. And it is a <b>position</b>, where the creature idle is a
 * <b>frame</b>: the five-frame cycle plays on top of this for the hovered card
 * and the two never interact.
 *
 * <p><b>Synchronised by construction.</b> The offset is a function of the
 * board's clock and nothing else — no card, no slot, no per-card stagger to pass
 * in — so two sprites cannot drift apart however they were dealt. That is
 * deliberately the opposite of {@link IdleCycle}, which staggers each card so
 * four creatures do not animate in lockstep: one breath shared by the whole
 * board reads as the room being lit by one torch, where four independent bobs
 * read as four loose sprites. The stagger still governs the frame cycle, which
 * is what it was for, and only the hovered card runs that anyway.
 *
 * <p>Amplitude is bounded by the well: a 128 sprite in a 140 well has six pixels
 * of clearance, and ±2 spends a third of it. Every step is even because sprites
 * draw at ×2 — an odd offset would move the art by half a source pixel.
