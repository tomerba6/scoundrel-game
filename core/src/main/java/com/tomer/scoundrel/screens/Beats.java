/**
 * When each board sound plays, read off the effect it belongs to — never typed
 * in. A move is settled the instant it is pressed, but the picture is not, and a
 * sound played on the press arrives before the thing it is the sound of. So each
 * sound waits for its effect's own clock to reach the moment the picture changes:
 * the slash crossing, the weapon reaching the rail, the bottle pouring, a card
 * landing. Retime an animation and its sound follows it.
 *
 * <p>Times are seconds on the effect's own clock, which the killing blow runs at
 * half speed — so its sound lands late with it, without anything here knowing.
 * The deal is on its own clock too, which only starts once the effect is over.
 *
 * <p>Pure and headless, so the timing table in {@code docs/audio.md} is tested
 * rather than trusted.
