/**
 * Tier two of the palette: every colour drawn in code that is <b>not</b> one of
 * the eighty ramp entries in {@link Ramps}.
 *
 * <p>{@code HANDOFF.md} §6 says the eighty "are also the only colours the UI
 * should use". That was never true and could not be — §11 of the same document
 * specifies chrome hexes that are on no ramp, and the potion bottle, the cleaved
 * card's cut faces and the HUD tints were sampled straight from the reference
 * render. <b>None of these were invented.</b> Each is either quoted in the brief
 * or taken off the art, which is why the answer is to write them down rather
 * than to repaint them.
 *
 * <p>{@code UiPaletteTest} is what keeps this honest: it reads both declaration
 * forms out of the source and fails on any colour in neither tier.
 *
 * <p><b>What this cannot govern: blended output.</b> {@code fill(…, 0x000000,
 * 0.5f)} puts a colour on screen that is on no ramp by construction, and
 * {@code HANDOFF.md} §11's "flat colour, never alpha" quietly loses to those
 * shadow lines. Bringing them onto flat palette steps would change pixels, so it
 * is deliberately out of scope here.
