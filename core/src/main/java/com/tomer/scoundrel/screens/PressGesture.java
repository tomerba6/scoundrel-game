/**
 * One press on a menu: which target is held, whether the pointer is still on it,
 * and how long the plate has been drawn down.
 *
 * <p>Menus act on <b>release</b>, and only if the release lands back on the
 * target the press started on — so a press can be taken back by sliding off,
 * which is what a button has always done. The board is the deliberate exception:
 * cards and the Avoid plate resolve on press, because a click made while the
 * mouse is already travelling to the next card is what fast play looks like and
 * release semantics silently discard it (HANDOFF §10). The board hit-tests its
 * own rectangles for that, in {@code GameScreen.BoardInput}.
 *
 * <p>The timing is why this is a class rather than two fields on a screen.
 * A click is often shorter than four frames, and every menu button navigates, so
 * acting the instant the button comes up would cut to the next screen before the
 * sunk plate had been drawn once — release semantics would read as <em>less</em>
 * responsive than the press-to-act they replaced. So a release only arms the
 * action; {@link #advance} fires it once the plate has actually been on screen
 * for {@link #MIN_SINK}. Targets are whatever integers the screen hit-tests to,
 * matching the {@code -1} for nothing that {@link ScreenArt#buttonAt} returns.
 *
 * <p>Pure and headless — no LibGDX here, so the whole state machine is tested
 * rather than screenshotted.
