 *
 * <p><b>It never takes the game down.</b> A file that fails to load is logged
 * once and then silent; a play that throws is caught. With no audio device at
 * all LibGDX hands back a silent mock and this runs on it unchanged. Sound is
 * never worth a crash.
 *
 * <p>Owned by {@code ScoundrelGame}, like the theme and the sprites, so every
 * screen plays through the one bank and the one {@link SfxChoice} — whose
 * memory of the last version played is what keeps repeats apart.
