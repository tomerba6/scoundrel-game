 * That is what this holds. Learn these and each screen is assembly work rather

 * renders the same way {@link BoardArt} was, not taken from the prose.
 *
 * <p>Coordinates are 1280×720 with y measured downward, as the art is
 * specified; {@link CardArt#toWorldY} converts when drawing.
 *
 * <p>Every {@code int} below that is not a colour is in design pixels; every
 * {@code _Y}, {@code _TOP} and {@code _DY} is measured downward, and a
 * {@code _DX} or {@code _DY} is an offset from its panel's or row's own
 * top-left. Colours are {@code 0xRRGGBB}.
