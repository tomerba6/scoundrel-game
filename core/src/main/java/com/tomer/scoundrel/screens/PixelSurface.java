/**
 * An offscreen surface exactly the size of the design resolution. The board is
 * drawn onto it at 1:1 and the finished image is then scaled to the window in a
 * single step.
 *
 * <p>Without it every draw call is scaled independently, and at a scale that is
 * not a whole number they do not agree. At 1920×1080 the viewport fits at ×1.5,
 * and the five identical 2px stems of the word AVOID came out 3, 2, 2, 3 and 2
 * screen pixels wide — each quad rounded on its own, so identical strokes
 * disagreed by half their width. Drawing them onto one integer grid first makes
 * every 2px feature exactly 3 screen pixels, because the whole image is
 * resampled once with one phase instead of a few hundred times with many.
 *
 * <p>It cannot make ×1.5 pixel-perfect — nothing can, since a single design
 * pixel has no whole number of screen pixels to occupy. Features one pixel
 * across still land on one screen pixel or two depending where they fall. What
 * changes is that the choice is now made consistently across the whole frame
 * rather than per draw call, which is the difference between a coarse image and
 * a scruffy one.

     * 0.72 fill, over a black clear.
     *
     * <p>The surface is the whole frame and opaque by construction: it is
     * cleared to an opaque colour and covers the viewport. There is nothing
     * behind it to blend with, so it is copied rather than composited.
