/**
 * Spilling a wasted potion: the second one taken in a room, which heals
 * nothing. The card collapses into the same bottle a drink does — drained of
 * colour by {@link SpentMask} — and it tips over and dribbles where the card
 * was.
 *
 * <p>It <b>goes nowhere</b>, and that is the whole effect. A wasted potion that
 * flew to the health bar and tipped over it with nothing to pour read as the
 * heal being broken; spilling it on the table says the potion was wasted, which
 * is what actually happened. Release 1 made the same distinction.
 *
 * <p>Shorter than a drink, too. Nothing is gained by it, so it has no business
 * holding the board as long as the one that heals you.
