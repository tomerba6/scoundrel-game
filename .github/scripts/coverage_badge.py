"""Generate a coverage badge for the packages the build actually gates.

Deliberately scoped. A whole-report number would average in `screens`, which is
GL-bound, screenshot-verified and excluded from the JaCoCo gate on purpose -- it
sits near 8%, and blending it in would report ~50% for an engine that is at 99%.
That would misrepresent the project in both directions depending on how much UI
code exists at the time, so the badge measures exactly what
`jacocoTestCoverageVerification` enforces, and the label says "engine" to be
clear it is not the whole repository.

Usage: coverage_badge.py <jacoco-xml> <out-svg>
